# AEColorama
Adobe After Effects "Colorama" Effect in Python.

## What does it do?
From a few colors, and their placement on a colorwheel, it creates a lookup table that maps all 256 possible grayscale values to a value interpolated between the values.

## What else does this do?
Well the main goal is to do some cool music visualizations, like have the colors on an image shift to the beat of the music. This is done by "spinning" the colorwheel a certain amount based on the intensity of the music in a given time period. It's not great right now, but it'll improve.
